Use of external css
External css is used when you want to make updates on multiple pages.
External css is best if you want to change the overall look of the entire web page by 
choosing one single file instead of changing in the html code itself which is hectic in nature as 
you have to change in multiple lines of code .

If you want to use external css you have to link the cs file to your html code using the <link> tag in the head section of your html code and save it with a ".css" extension.

Syntax of linking the css file

<head>  
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="divyam.css">  
</head>  

Example of a css file 

body {  
    background-color: darkblue;  
}  
h1 {  
    color: black;  
    margin-left: 40px;  
}
